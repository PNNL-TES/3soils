Establishment,Establishment of oldest trees*,"Establishment of oldest trees. Date of establishment estimated based on age of the oldest trees (e.g., using cores and tree rings). This is not necessarily equal to the time of stand establishment, particularly for older stands. The year of Establishment of oldest trees can be calculated if both stand.age and measurement date are given in the traits table. *Indicates record where it was assumed that establishment of oldest trees occurred in the same year as the initiation of forest regrowth/natural succession.",NA
Establishment,Establishment of key species,Establishment of a keystone/ dominant tree species or taxa. Notes should the taxa.,NA
Regrowth(_prior),Initiation of post-disturbance cohort (planted or natural)*,"Initiation of post-disturbance cohort (following significant disturbance), unknown whether via natural succession or planting. *Indicates record where it was assumed that this was the same year as establishment of oldest trees.",NA
Regrowth(_prior),Initiation of post-disturbance cohort (natural)*,"Initiation of post-disturbance cohort (following significant disturbance) via natural succession. Date of event estimated based on land history records (e.g., records of fire history, satellite records of land cover, and interviews of land owners). *Indicates record where it was assumed that this was the same year as establishment of oldest trees.

Disturbance(_prior),Burned,"Includes prescribed burns, wildfires, and slash-and-burn events.","cycles (slash-and-burn), times, ha, km2, kW m-1"
Disturbance(_prior),Cultivation,Any form of cultivation. Use Tillage if soil was tilled.,"months, seasons, years, harvests"
Disturbance(_prior),Cut,"Forest cutting, without removing (all) wood from site, or when it is unknown whether wood was removed from site. When wood was removed from site, ""Harvest"" is used.  100% tree mortality indicates clear-cutting. Slash-and-burn events are indicated by Burned + Cut (100 %).",multiple

Management,Soil disturbance,"Mechanical soil disturbance (e.g.,  tillage, ditching, trenching, installation of soil warming cables, soil scarification, adding soil to improve cultivation). This is distinct from Disturbance:Tillage in that it does not involve forest clearing", (depth)

No.disturbance,No disturbance,"Indicates no known anthropogenic impacts or severe/stand replancing disturbance (since the associated year, when given).
