Hi Ben,
Please find attached the template for steps to obtain dissolved (aqueous) and total gas concentrations. I have added example calculations to the spreadsheet from this past summer in rows 5 (methane) and 6 (carbon dioxode). 

I tried to breakdown the multiple steps as much as possible; please let me know if you have any questions.

Importantly, the values for the Henry's constant are in partial pressure (atm)/mole fraction. I have included the citations and sources for your reference. I inherited these values from my mentors while in Oak Ridge, and never did read the empirical studies (from the 1980s). I was able to locate a source from Colorado State that was comprehensive in listing values for a number of analytes, and that matched my values.

Hope this is useful!
Thanks,
Taniya
